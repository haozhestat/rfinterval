Description: An integrated package for constructing random forest prediction intervals using a fast implementation pacakge 'ranger'. This package can apply the following three methods: the out-of-bag prediction interval introduced in Zhang et al. (2019), the split conformal method described in Lei et al. (2018), as well as quantile regression forest
